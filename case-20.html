           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased was found in her bedroom at home, lying on the bed. The room emitted an unusual sour odor. According to the roommate, the deceased had displayed severe symptoms of poisoning several hours prior, including intense abdominal pain, vomiting, and dizziness. At that time, the deceased was extremely anxious and continuously complained of severe abdominal pain. Upon discovery of the body, the room was not in disarray, but there was vomit on the bed sheets, indicating that the deceased had vomited several hours before death." data-zh="死者的遺體於家中卧室內發現，當時遺體位於床上，房間內散發著一股異常的酸臭氣味。根據室友描述，死者在數小時前曾表現出嚴重的腹痛、嘔吐及頭暈等中毒症狀。死者當時情緒十分焦慮，並且持續抱怨腹部劇痛。發現遺體時，室內未見明顯混亂，床單上有嘔吐物，顯示死者在死亡前數小時內曾嘔吐過。"></p>

There were no visible external injuries on the skin, but the limbs showed slight rigidity, indicating that some time had passed since death. The deceased's eyes were slightly open, with no signs of pupil dilation, and there was no significant external bleeding or other signs of trauma." data-zh="死者穿著家居服，面色蒼白，嘴唇發紫，且身體呈現輕微的發熱狀態。死者的皮膚並未顯示明顯外傷，四肢呈現略微僵硬，顯示死亡時間距發現已有一段時間。死者的眼睛微微張開，並無瞳孔散大現象，且並未出現過度出血或其他外部創傷。"></p>

There was noticeable redness and swelling in the stomach and small intestine, along with signs of inflammation, consistent with symptoms of seafood poisoning. Blood tests indicated a high level of alcohol in the deceased’s system, suggesting that after consuming raw oysters, the deceased may have ingested a large quantity of high-proof alcohol, which exacerbated the poisoning. The liver showed no significant abnormalities; however, due to the combined effects of alcohol and food poisoning, the liver’s detoxification function was unable to cope with the large amount of toxins, ultimately leading to death." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，死者的胃部有大量未完全消化的食物，主要為生鮮生蚝及其他海鮮，顯示食物中毒的可能性。胃部及小腸內部有明顯的紅腫現象，並且發現部分炎症，符合生鮮海鮮中毒的典型症狀。血液檢測顯示死者體內的酒精濃度偏高，推測死者可能在食用生鮮生蚝後大量飲用高度數酒精，進一步加重了中毒情況。肝臟無顯著異常，但因為飲酒和食物中毒共同作用，肝臟的解毒功能未能及時應對大量毒素，最終導致死亡。"></p>

After consuming a large quantity of raw oysters, which were not properly processed or cooked, and simultaneously ingesting a significant amount of high-proof alcohol, the deceased experienced severe gastrointestinal reactions. This led to organ failure and ultimately death." data-zh="根據屍檢及現場調查結果，死者的死亡原因為食物中毒，並伴隨過度飲酒所引發的急性中毒反應。死者在食用大量生鮮生蚝後，未經適當處理或烹煮，並且同時攝入大量高度酒精，造成腸胃系統的劇烈反應，最終導致器官衰竭和死亡。">
