           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="Female deceased, 19 years old, died on the evening of January 12, 2021 at 11:30 PM." data-zh="死者女，19歲，於2021年1月12日晚間11點30分發現死亡。"></p>
           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased's body was found inside a farm grain barn, near an old grain crusher. The barn had a strong odor, and the floor was scattered with animal manure, straw, and some bloodstains, which extended from the area near the crusher to the machine's interior. The upper body of the deceased was lodged in the entrance of the crusher, dressed in a white shirt and jeans, with part of the clothing torn and caught in the machine's gears. The lower body was exposed, and the leg joints were unnaturally twisted. There were no obvious signs of struggle in the barn, but the deceased's hands showed scratches and marks consistent with mechanical operation, suggesting that the deceased may have tried to operate the crusher or climb the machine structure before death. Nearby the machine, a broken bottle and an open lighter were found, indicating that the deceased may have consumed alcohol before entering the barn area." data-zh="死者遺體發現於農場穀倉內，靠近一台老舊的穀物粉碎機。穀倉內氣味濃重，地面散佈著動物糞便、稻草及部分血跡，血跡從粉碎機附近蔓延至機器內部。死者的上半身卡在粉碎機入口，身著白色襯衫與牛仔褲，衣物部分撕裂，殘留於機械齒輪間。遺體下半身裸露於外，腿部關節位置呈不自然扭曲。穀倉內無明顯掙扎痕跡，但死者手部留有抓痕與機械操作痕跡，初步推測其死亡前試圖操作粉碎機或攀爬機械結構。現場機械周圍散落有一個破裂的酒瓶及一隻開啟的打火機，顯示死者可能飲酒後進入穀倉區域。"></p>

        <span class="chinese-text report-text report-heading" data-en="External Examination" data-zh="外部檢查"></span>
           <br>
           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased's head, neck, and shoulders sustained severe mechanical injuries. The skull was fractured, and the skin and muscle tissue showed signs of being torn by sharp gears. Both arms exhibited fine scratches, consistent with attempts to stabilize oneself or escape from the machine. The lower abdomen showed no obvious trauma, but the knees were dislocated, likely caused by the body's impact with the machine and the resulting recoil. The deceased's face was covered in blood, with significant deformation, indicating a powerful blow to the head. Fragments of straw and blood were found under the deceased's fingernails, further confirming that the deceased made survival attempts during the machine's operation." data-zh="死者頭部、頸部及肩部受重度機械損傷，顱骨破裂，皮膚及肌肉組織呈現被鋒利齒輪撕裂的特徵。雙臂留有細微抓痕，符合意圖穩定自身或試圖逃離機械的行為痕跡。腹部下方無明顯創傷，腿部膝關節脫臼，可能由身體被卡入機械時的反作用力引起。死者面部血跡斑駁，五官明顯變形，顯示頭部遭受強大撞擊。指指甲內留有稻草碎片及血污，進一步驗證死者在機械運作過程中曾有求生行動。"></p>

        <span class="chinese-text report-text report-heading" data-en="Internal Examination" data-zh="內部檢查"></span>
           <br>
           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="Internal examination revealed multiple comminuted fractures of the deceased's skull, with severe brain tissue damage. The cervical spine was fractured due to force, but there was no additional damage to the thoracic cavity or abdominal organs, suggesting that death occurred rapidly with almost no signs of struggle. The stomach contents indicated a high concentration of alcohol, supporting the possibility that the deceased had consumed a large amount of alcohol prior to death." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，死者顱骨多處粉碎性骨折，腦部組織嚴重受損。頸椎受力斷裂，胸腔內部並無額外損傷，腹腔器官保持完整，顯示死亡迅速，幾乎無掙扎過程。胃內容物顯示酒精濃度偏高，支持死者生前曾大量飲酒的可能性。"></p>

         <span class="chinese-text report-text report-heading" data-en="Cause of Death" data-zh="死亡原因"></span>
           <br>
           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="Based on the autopsy and scene investigation, the cause of death has been determined to be a fatal mechanical accident, with the direct cause being cranial injury and hypovolemic shock. Scene evidence suggests that the deceased may have lost their judgment due to alcohol consumption and accidentally activated the grain crusher, leading to the tragic event. The machine was old and lacked safety precautions, which were the primary contributing factors to the accident." data-zh="根據屍檢及現場調查結果，死者的死亡原因判定為機械事故致死，直接死因為顱內損傷及失血性休克。現場線索顯示死者可能因飲酒後失去判斷能力，誤觸穀物粉碎機導致不幸事件。機械老舊且未見安全防護措施，為事故的主要誘因。">
