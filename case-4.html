                <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The body was found lying near the rocks by the Miami shoreline, dressed in a white sundress. Nearby, a camera was discovered containing several photographs. The images showed the deceased with her family enjoying time at the beach. Additionally, one of the photos included the image of a dead bird, whose body was found not far from where the deceased's body was located. No other items potentially linked to the cause of death were found at the scene." data-zh="死者倒臥於邁阿密海邊礁石附近，穿著白色吊帶裙，身旁發現一只相機，內裡存有幾張照片，照片中可見死者與家人一同在海邊遊玩的畫面。另外，照片中還有一只死掉鳥類的影像，鳥類屍體與死者遺體的發現地點相距不遠。現場未發現其他可能導致死亡的物品。"></p>

                <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased's skin appeared notably pale, a common physiological reaction after drowning. There were minor abrasions on her knees and lower legs, likely caused by contact with the rocks when she fell into the sea. These abrasions were superficial, did not contribute to the primary cause of death, and showed no signs of infection. Facial examination revealed no visible trauma; the lips were slightly pale, and the pupils were fixed, consistent with typical physiological characteristics of death by drowning." data-zh="死者皮膚整體較為蒼白，這是溺水後常見的生理反應。她的雙膝和小腿部位有少量擦傷，推測為跌入海中時與礁石接觸所致。這些擦傷較為淺表，並不影響主要死因，且未見感染跡象。面部檢查未發現明顯創傷，嘴唇微微發白，眼睛瞳孔固定，符合溺水死亡後的典型生理特徵。"></p>

The heart and other major internal organs showed no abnormalities. The stomach was empty, consistent with the typical condition of drowning where no food remains in the stomach. Blood tests detected no toxins or drug components, ruling out poisoning or drug-induced death as possible causes." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，死者的呼吸道內有海水和泡沫，肺部充滿海水，並顯示出明顯的水腫和氣泡狀改變，這是溺水死亡的典型生理表現。心臟及其他重要內臟器官未見異常，胃內沒有食物，符合溺水後胃內容物為空的情況。血液檢查未發現毒物或藥物成分，排除了中毒或藥物引起的死亡可能性。"></p>

                <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The cause of death has been confirmed as drowning. It is suspected that the deceased entered the water for an unknown reason and, due to the strong currents and the presence of surrounding rocks, was unable to save herself, ultimately resulting in drowning. The external abrasions are likely from contact with rocks during the fall into the water. While there is currently no conclusive evidence to suggest suicide, the possibility cannot be ruled out. The significance of the photograph showing the bird’s corpse remains unclear, and further investigation is needed to determine whether there is any connection between it and the deceased’s death." data-zh="死者的死因確認是溺水。死者可能因某種原因跳入海中，且由於海水湍急及周圍礁石的存在，未能及時自救，最終導致溺水死亡。外部擦傷可能是在落水過程中與礁石接觸所致。雖然目前沒有確鑿證據表明其為自殺，但無法排除自殺的可能性。鳥類屍體的照片意義尚不明確，尚需進一步調查其與死者死亡之間是否存在任何聯繫。"></p>
