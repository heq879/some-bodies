           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The body was found on the stone slab in the front yard in front of the house. The deceased's room was on the third floor, with the window open, suggesting that she may have jumped from the window. The impact marks from the fall were evident, indicating that the deceased may have struggled after the fall but did not die immediately. According to information provided by the family, the deceased had a heated argument with her mother before her death, and her emotional distress may have been the trigger for her decision to jump." data-zh="死者遺體發現於家門口前院石板上，死者房間位於三樓，窗戶開啟，顯示死者可能從該窗戶跳下。墜落後的撞擊痕跡明顯，死者可能在墜落後經歷了掙扎，但未立即死亡。根據家人提供的信息，死者在死亡前與母親爆發了激烈的爭吵,情緒激動可能成為死者決定跳樓的誘因。"></p>

The body showed typical injuries from a high fall, particularly noticeable impact damage to the chest, abdomen, and lower limbs. The head and limbs exhibited multiple bruises, and several joints of the body were dislocated, consistent with the impact of hitting the ground after the fall. The skin was pale and had a noticeable coldness, indicating that the deceased had not received warmth or emergency treatment before death." data-zh="死者穿著睡衣，未見外力撕裂或其他異常痕跡，表明墜落前未經受過其他暴力侵害。死者的身體顯示出典型的高處墜落傷害，特別是胸部、腹部及下肢有明顯的撞擊損傷。頭部及四肢呈現多處瘀傷，身體的幾個關節有錯位現象，符合墜落後撞擊地面的情況。皮膚呈現蒼白並有明顯的冰冷感，表明死者在死亡前未及時獲得保暖或急救。"></p>

While the heart structure showed no significant abnormalities, there were signs of bleeding caused by trauma. The lungs showed severe damage from the impact, and some airways exhibited signs of being impacted. The deceased did not die immediately after the fall, but rather endured a period of time without receiving medical treatment, likely leading to death due to hypothermia, shock, and weakened will to survive." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，死者內部有多處創傷，特別是胸腔及腹腔內臟器官受損，導致內出血。心臟結構雖無明顯病變，但有創傷引起的出血跡象。肺部顯示重度碰撞後的損傷，並且部分氣道有受到衝擊的痕跡。死者未在墜落後立即死亡，而是在受傷後經歷了一段時間未獲得救治，並可能因為低體溫、休克以及求生意志薄弱等原因導致死亡。"></p>

This incident is consistent with a suicidal fall, with no signs of violence or other external interference." data-zh="死者死因為從高處墜落後的撞擊創傷及長時間未得到救治，未即時獲得醫療處置。死者在死亡前曾與母親發生激烈爭吵，這可能是誘發死者決定跳樓的因素之一。此事件符合自殺性墜落的情況，無暴力或其他外力干預跡象。"></p>
