The surroundings were tidy, and there were no signs of struggle or conflict, suggesting a peaceful passing. Inside the wardrobe, an empty bottle of sleeping pills was found, labeled as a prescription medication with a dosage exceeding the normal range. A suicide note was also discovered at the scene, written in a calm tone, expressing despair about life and apologies to her family.According to family accounts, the deceased had been experiencing emotional distress in recent times, had a history of self-harm and alcohol abuse, and had argued with family members shortly before her death. These findings initially point to suicide as the likely cause of death." data-zh="死者遺體發現於其家中卧室的衣櫃內，遺體呈仰臥狀態，環境整潔。遺體周圍無打鬥或掙扎痕跡，顯示死亡過程較為平靜。衣櫃內發現一個空的安眠藥瓶，瓶身標註顯示為處方藥，且劑量大於正常使用範圍。現場發現一封遺書，內容平和，提及對生活的無望及對家人的歉意，初步判斷為死者自殺所留。經家人描述，死者近期情緒低落，死亡前曾與家人發生爭吵，並長期有自殘及酗酒行為。"></p>

Blood analysis showed high concentrations of both sleeping pills and alcohol, suggesting the deceased likely consumed an excessive dose of medication after drinking alcohol.

On the day of the suicide, the individual had an argument with family members, which may have exacerbated suicidal tendencies. The contents of the suicide note were calm, expressing apologies to the family, with no signs of external intervention or violence." data-zh="根據屍檢結果，死者的死亡判定為自殺。直接死因為過量服用安眠藥與酒精聯合作用引起心肺功能衰竭。死者長期情緒低落並有自殘及酗酒行為，自殺當日與家人發生爭吵，可能加劇其自殺傾向。遺書內容平和，表達對家人的歉意，無他人干預或暴力行為跡象。"></p>
