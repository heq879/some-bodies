           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased's body was found in the bathtub of the bathroom. The tub was filled with blood-colored water, appearing pink due to significant blood loss. The deceased was dressed in a dress, her clothing was neat, with no signs of violent intervention. The bathroom environment was orderly, with no signs of struggle or violence, indicating that the deceased likely died in a relatively calm state.
            A deep laceration was found on the left wrist, and a bloodied eyebrow razor was discovered at the edge of the bathtub. The razor blade showed traces of blood, which, based on initial examination, appears consistent with the wound's shape. Minor bloodstains were also found on the fingertips and palm of the right hand, suggesting the deceased may have been holding the razor before death. No suicide note was found at the scene, and there were no other suspicious items or signs around the area." data-zh="死者遺體發現於浴室浴缸內，浴缸中充滿血水，水呈粉紅色，顯示大量失血。死者身著吊帶裙，衣物整齊，無暴力干預的跡象。浴室環境整潔，未見掙扎或暴力跡象，顯示死者在相對安靜的狀態下死亡。死者左手腕處有深切割傷，浴缸邊緣發現一把帶血的刮眉刀，刀片上有殘留血跡，經初步判斷與傷口形態相符。右手指尖及掌心部位亦有輕微血跡，顯示其生前可能握持刮眉刀。現場未發現遺書，周邊無其他可疑物品或跡象。"></p>

           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased had pale skin with noticeable skin wrinkling, especially in areas that had been submerged in the blood-filled water for an extended period. The left wrist showed two deep, regular cuts with clean edges, indicating they were made with a sharp object, consistent with the characteristics of an eyebrow razor. The depth of the wounds was sufficient to sever major blood vessels and some nerves, making them fatal injuries. Numerous old scars were present on the wrist, arranged irregularly, suggesting a pattern of long-term self-harming behavior. No significant external injuries or abnormal marks were found on the rest of the body." data-zh="死者膚色蒼白，皮膚皺縮明顯，尤其是長時間浸泡於血水的部位。左手腕有兩道規律且深的切割傷，切口邊緣整齊，顯示由鋒利器物造成，符合刮眉刀的傷口特徵。傷口深度足以切斷主要血管和部分神經，為致命性傷口。死者手腕處的舊傷痕數量較多，排列不規則，顯示長期自我傷害的行為模式。其餘身體部位無顯著外傷或異常痕跡。"></p>

There was significant damage to the arteries, veins, and nerve fibers in the left wrist, with blood loss reaching a fatal level. The heart had stopped beating, and ischemic damage was evident in the lungs and other internal organs, indicating a loss of function. The stomach contained only a small amount of food, and toxicology results showed no traces of drugs or poison." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，死者因割腕導致的大量失血引發失血性休克並最終死亡。左腕的動脈、靜脈及神經纖維均有明顯損傷，出血量達致命標準。心臟停止跳動，肺部及其他內臟器官因缺血性損害呈現失功能跡象。胃內僅含少量食物，毒物檢測結果顯示無藥物或毒品殘留。"></p>

           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="Based on the autopsy results, the cause of death has been determined to be suicide. The direct cause of death was hypovolemic shock due to the wrist lacerations. The scene and environmental conditions are consistent with suicide, although no suicide note was found. Multiple old scars on the deceased's wrist suggest a history of long-term self-harming behavior. The eyebrow razor was identified as the lethal weapon, and no signs of external intervention or violence were found." data-zh="根據屍檢及現場調查結果，死者的死亡原因判定為自殺。直接死因為割腕導致的失血性休克。現場環境與自殺特徵一致，未發現遺書，但死者手腕處的多處舊傷痕表明其曾有長期自殘行為。刮眉刀作為致命性凶器，未發現其他人為干預或暴力行為跡象。"></p>
