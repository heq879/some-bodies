           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased's body was found by the search and rescue team several kilometers away from the crash site after the aviation accident. At the time of the incident, the flight was severely impacted by extreme blizzard conditions, with visibility near zero, wind speeds exceeding 120 kilometers per hour, and heavy snowfall. Due to the harsh weather, search efforts were incredibly challenging, and many crew members and passengers were unable to receive timely rescue. According to preliminary investigation, the aircraft lost control and crashed after encountering the blizzard, shortly before reaching its intended destination. Given the lack of viable survival chances, the deceased's death is directly attributed to the plane crash. Prior to the accident, the plane had lost communication and had been descending rapidly." data-zh="死者的遺體於空難事故後，由搜救隊於一處距離航線事故現場數公里處發現。該事故發生時，該航班受到了極端暴風雪影響，視距極為有限，風速達每小時一百二十公里以上，並伴隨著強降雪。由於氣候惡劣，事故後的搜尋工作極為困難，許多機組人員和乘客未能及時獲得救援。根據初步調查，機體在接近預定目的地前，由於遭遇到暴風雪，失控墜落。由於缺乏足夠的生還機會，死者的死亡與空難事故直接相關。至事故發生前，飛機已經失去聯繫並進行過急速下降。"></p>

           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased was wearing the standard safety clothing issued by the airline, with minor bloodstains and damage primarily concentrated on the head and chest areas. The head sustained severe impact trauma, likely caused by the intense force of the plane’s violent turbulence or the impact upon hitting the ground during the crash. All four limbs exhibited fractures, indicating the extreme force of the impact during the fall." data-zh="死者身穿飛機座位配發的安全衣物，衣物上有少量的血跡及受損痕跡，主要集中於頭部和胸部。死者頭部受到劇烈撞擊，推測由於飛機的劇烈衝擊或墜地時的撞擊所致。四肢均有骨折痕跡，顯示墜落過程中的衝擊力量極大。"></p>

The brain sustained significant damage with widespread internal hemorrhaging, likely due to the impact of the crash. Important internal organs such as the heart, liver, and spleen also showed signs of extensive internal bleeding, indicating that the death was a direct consequence of the snowstorm-induced plane crash. Blood tests confirmed that the deceased had not been affected by any drugs or abnormal substances." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，死者因頭部劇烈撞擊及多處骨折導致的內部出血而死亡。死者的腦部受到重創，且有廣泛的內部出血，推測為墜落時的衝擊造成。心臟、肝臟及脾臟等重要內臟器官也顯示出大量內出血，顯示暴風雪引起的空難事故造成了死亡的直接後果。血液檢測顯示，死者未受到任何毒品或異常物質的影響。"></p>

The deceased ultimately died from internal bleeding and multiple fractures. The crash occurred as a result of a snowstorm that affected the flight path, causing the aircraft to lose control and eventually crash. The deceased did not survive the incident. The investigation into the crash is still ongoing." data-zh="根據屍檢及現場調查結果，死者死亡原因為因空難事故所致的頭部及身體重創，最終因內部出血及多處骨折死亡。該事故由於暴風雪影響飛行航線並引發機體失控，最終導致飛機墜落，死者在事故中未能倖存。目前該事故仍在調查階段。">
