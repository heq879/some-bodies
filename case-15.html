At the time of discovery, the male homeowner was present, and the environment was noisy due to a Miao ethnic festival being held outside, with sounds carrying into the room. The deceased's facial expression showed signs of distress, and her lips were purple, suggesting poisoning as the likely cause of death. According to witnesses, the deceased had been drinking and dancing with the homeowner's daughter before the incident, and the atmosphere had been cheerful without any unusual behavior observed. No suspicious items were found near the deceased, and her clothing was neat with no bloodstains. Local residents mentioned that the deceased and her companion had interacted with an elderly villager, who was rumored to practice 「sorcery」 in the area." data-zh="死者的遺體被發現於中國貴州省千戶苗寨中宅房餐桌前的椅子上。當時，房屋內有男主人在場，環境嘈雜，戶外正在舉行苗族傳統節日，聲音傳入室內。死者面部表情痛苦，嘴唇呈紫色，推測為中毒所致。根據目擊者描述，死者生前曾與宅主的女兒共同飲酒跳舞，整體氣氛輕鬆愉快，並未見有異常行為。死者身邊未發現任何可疑物品，衣物整齊無血跡。當地居民提到，死者及其伴侶曾與一名年長的村民接觸，而這名長者在當地有「 下蠱 」的傳聞。"></p>

Blood tests detected high concentrations of suspicious toxins, potentially linked to alcohol consumption or toxins present in other ingested foods. The heart showed no abnormalities, and no abnormal changes were found in the lungs. Further analysis revealed trace amounts of an unknown substance in the body, which may be associated with local beliefs surrounding witchcraft (known as gǔ).
