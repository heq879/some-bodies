The surrounding environment was cold, with no other apparent signs of disturbance. The deceased had been missing for approximately two weeks, and the body was found in a frozen state.

          The notes app on the deceased’s phone contained text resembling a possible suicide note. However, due to the vague nature of the content, it cannot be confirmed as a precursor to suicide. No signs of violence or the presence of others were found at the scene." data-zh="死者遺體發現於拉里坦河小道的長椅上，周圍環境寒冷且無其他明顯跡象。死者在失踪後已經消失了約兩週，並且遺體在發現時已經處於凍僵狀態。死者的手機備忘錄中包含一些疑似遺書的文字，但由於內容模糊，無法確認是否為死者自殺的前兆。現場未發現其他暴力痕跡，且未見他人存在。"></p>
