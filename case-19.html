           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased was found along the Hoboken Riverbank, near the Hoboken train station. There were no signs of rescue attempts at the scene. The environment was cold at the time of the incident, with swift currents in the river and an uneven water surface, as waves splashed against nearby railings. According to witnesses, the deceased walked alone to the riverbank during the early morning hours and seemingly jumped into the water without hesitation. After several hours of immersion in the cold water, the body was discovered showing signs of hypothermia, with exposed skin turning dark purple. The body had been exposed to the elements for an extended period, as evidenced by the damage caused by seagulls feeding on it." data-zh="死者遺體發現於霍博肯河岸，靠近霍博肯火車站，現場並無明顯的救援跡象。事發時環境陰冷河水湍急， 水面不平靜，有浪花打到附近的欄杆上。根據目擊者描述，死者於清晨時分獨自走近河邊，隨後似乎毫無猶豫地跳入河中。經過數小時的冷水浸泡，遺體被發現時已明顯受寒冷影響，部分暴露的皮膚呈現暗紫色，顯示失溫症狀。死者的遺體在發現時被海鷗啃噬，顯示死亡後遺體處於長時間的暴露狀況。"></p>

           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased was wearing autumn clothing, which was soaked and showed clear signs of water immersion. The face appeared dark purple, with lips blackened, likely due to prolonged oxygen deprivation and hypothermia. No other external injuries or abnormalities were observed. The limbs were stiff, indicating a rapid drop in body temperature after death. There were no signs of violence or trauma on the body. The surrounding environment was quiet, with strong winds and the sound of water waves, and there was no indication of any third-party involvement." data-zh="死者穿著秋季衣物，衣物濕透並顯示出水浸痕跡。面部呈暗紫色，嘴唇發黑，推測為長時間缺氧及失溫所致。未見其他外部創傷或異常，四肢有僵硬現象，顯示死者死亡後的體溫迅速下降。死者遺體並未見暴力侵襲或創傷。周圍環境安靜，只有強風和水浪聲，未顯示有他人干預。"></p>

           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="Internal examination revealed no abnormalities in the deceased's heart and lungs, although the lungs showed mild edema, consistent with typical drowning symptoms. Brain examination indicated hypoxic damage, confirming that the deceased did not receive adequate oxygen while submerged in the water. Toxicology tests found no signs of any poisons. The cause of death is presumed to be a result of jumping into the fast-flowing water and being unable to rescue oneself, leading to severe hypothermia and oxygen deprivation. No other abnormal medical history or external injuries were observed, ruling out the possibility of foul play or suicide." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，死者的心臟和肺部未見異常，肺部呈現輕微水腫，符合典型溺水症狀。腦部檢查顯示有缺氧性損傷，證實死者在水中時長時間未能獲得足夠氧氣。血液檢測未發現任何毒物，推測死因為由於跳入湍急的水中後無法自救，導致過度失溫和缺氧。死者未顯示其他異常病史且無外傷，排除了暴力襲擊或自殺的可能性。"></p>

The deceased spent an extended period in the cold water without receiving timely medical assistance, ultimately succumbing to hypothermia and oxygen deprivation. The fast-moving water likely exacerbated the difficulty faced by the deceased. Upon discovery, there was no evidence of suicide or homicide." data-zh="根據屍檢及現場調查結果，死者的死亡原因為跳河導致過度失溫及缺氧引起的死亡。死者在冷水中停留時間過長，未能及時獲得醫療幫助，最終因為失溫及缺氧而喪命。水面的湍急，可能加劇了死者的困難。遺體發現時，未見自殺或他殺的證據 。">
