           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased’s body was found buried under approximately 30 to 50 centimeters of snow, with no visible external injuries or signs of a struggle. According to eyewitness accounts, the body was completely covered by snow at the time of discovery, with only a slight mound on the snow’s surface revealing part of the body. The surrounding snow was undisturbed and showed no additional footprints, indicating that the deceased was not interfered with by others and may have been exposed in the snow for an extended period before being found." data-zh="死者遺體被覆蓋在約叁拾至伍拾公分厚的積雪下，未見明顯外傷或搏鬥痕跡。根據目擊者描述，發現遺體時已完全被積雪覆蓋，只有少量雪面微微隆起，暴露出遺體的一部分。周圍積雪平整，未見其他足跡，表明死者在遺體被發現時未曾受到他人干預，且可能已在雪地中長時間暴露。"></p>

           The deceased was dressed in a red sweater, pants, and boots, with the clothing showing no signs of tearing or damage caused by external forces, indicating that no violent acts occurred prior to the discovery of the body. The skin was pale and cold, exhibiting frostbite typical of severe hypothermia. Frostbite damage was particularly evident on the extremities, including the fingers, toes, and ears, suggesting prolonged exposure to extreme cold. The body was rigid, consistent with the typical characteristics of freezing after death." data-zh="死者穿著一件紅色毛衣、長褲及靴子，衣物未見撕裂或因外力造成的傷痕，表明在遺體被發現時並未發生暴力行為。死者全身皮膚呈現典型的蒼白、冰冷，表現出嚴重低溫所致的凍傷跡象，四肢及耳朵末端有明顯的凍瘡損傷，顯示其體溫在極端低溫環境下持續下降。死者身體呈現僵硬狀態，符合死亡後凍僵的典型特徵。"></p>

The heart structure was normal, and other internal organs showed no signs of disease or damage. The cause of death was confirmed as hypothermia, with the prolonged exposure to extreme cold leading to a critical drop in body temperature and eventual cardiac arrest. Blood tests showed no presence of alcohol or toxins, and the respiratory tract was clear of any obstructions, ruling out asphyxiation as a contributing factor." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，遺體體內部未見致命內傷或病變，心臟結構正常，其他內臟器官無異常。死亡原因確定為凍死，推測死者長時間暴露於極寒環境中，體溫過低最終導致心臟停搏。血液檢測未顯示酒精或毒物，呼吸道無異物，排除了窒息等情況。"></p>

The clothing worn by the deceased was insufficient to protect against the severe cold, likely contributing directly to her death. Scene investigations revealed that the body was covered by snow when discovered, suggesting that the deceased had been in the snow for several hours or possibly longer." data-zh="根據屍檢結果，死者的死亡原因為凍死，主要是由於長時間暴露於極端低溫的環境中，未能及時得到溫暖和庇護。死者身穿的衣物不足以抵禦當時的寒冷，可能是死亡的直接原因之一。根據現場勘查，屍體發現時已被積雪覆蓋，顯示出死者可能已經在雪中待了數小時或更長時間。"></p>
