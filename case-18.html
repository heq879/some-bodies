           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased was found in the bedroom of her own apartment, which is a relatively enclosed, small residential unit. Upon examination of the scene, the air inside the room was found to be unusually stagnant, with no visible external injuries observed. An air purifier was found nearby, but it appeared ineffective in improving the airflow in the room. The cause of death is suspected to be poisoning due to high formaldehyde concentrations. The apartment's furniture, flooring, and decoration materials appeared to be newly renovated, suggesting the possibility of elevated formaldehyde levels. According to the deceased’s roommate, she had spent extended periods of time in the room and had exhibited symptoms of poisoning such as headaches and nausea." data-zh="死者的遺體發現於自家公寓的臥室內，公寓為一間較為封閉的小型住宅。根據現場檢查，室內空氣異常沉悶，未見任何明顯的可見外傷。死者身旁有開放的空氣清新機，但並未有效改善室內空氣流通，疑似由於甲醛濃度過高導致中毒。公寓內的家具、地板及裝潢材料顯示有較新的裝修，推測可能存在甲醛濃度過高的情況。根據死者室友的描述，死者有在此房間內長時間逗留，並曾表現出頭痛、噁心等中毒症狀。"></p>

           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased was wearing casual home attire, with a pale complexion and slightly bluish lips. No obvious signs of trauma or external violence were observed. The limbs showed no abnormal changes, and the body did not exhibit signs of extreme weakness. However, the deceased's facial expression indicated confusion and distress, suggesting a prolonged period of hypoxia or discomfort. The posture was natural, with no signs of violent reactions, and the overall condition of the body is consistent with typical symptoms of formaldehyde poisoning." data-zh="死者穿著居家服裝，面部呈蒼白色，嘴唇輕微發紫。未見明顯創傷或外部暴力跡象。四肢無異常變化，身體未顯示過度衰弱的徵兆，但死者的表情顯示出困惑與痛苦，似乎經歷過長時間的缺氧或不適。死者姿勢自然，未見暴力反應，身體狀況符合甲醛中毒的典型症狀。"></p>

No abnormalities were found in other major organs. Blood tests did not reveal any suspicious substances, with the only abnormal finding being reactive damage in the lungs, caused by formaldehyde exposure. As formaldehyde enters the respiratory system, it rapidly induces acute toxic reactions, leading to pulmonary edema and asphyxiation, ultimately resulting in death." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，死者的呼吸道有微量的水腫，肺部呈現急性充血狀況，並且有液體積聚，顯示為甲醛引起的呼吸道中毒症狀。其他主要器官未見異常血液檢測未發現其他可疑物質，唯一異常指標為肺部出現的甲醛引起的反應性損傷。由於甲醛進入呼吸系統後，會迅速引發急性中毒反應，導致肺水腫和窒息，最終造成死亡。"></p>

The apartment where the deceased resided posed a risk of elevated formaldehyde concentrations, and prolonged exposure to such an environment worsened the condition. The failure to promptly recognize and address the allergic and toxic symptoms ultimately led to death." data-zh="根據屍檢及現場調查結果，死者的死亡原因為過度吸入甲醛氣體所引起的急性中毒反應，導致呼吸衰竭及肺水腫。死者居住的公寓存在甲醛濃度過高的風險，長時間暴露於這樣的環境中加劇了病情的惡化。由於未能及時發現並處理過敏及中毒症狀，最終導致了死亡。">
