           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased was found in the garden area of People's Park in Shanghai, during the peak of the spring pollen season, with many flowering plants around. The deceased was lying on the ground with a purple complexion, indicative of hypoxia or difficulty breathing. According to witnesses, the deceased suddenly exhibited symptoms of allergic reactions, including shortness of breath, paleness, and coughing while walking in the garden. The individual was unable to seek medical attention in time and ultimately collapsed and died. No obvious external injuries were found at the scene, suggesting that no violent assault occurred." data-zh="死者的遺體發現於上海市人民公園的花園區內，當時正值春季花粉高峰期，周圍有大量開花植物。死者臥於地面，面部呈紫色，為缺氧或呼吸困難所致。根據目擊者描述，死者在花園中活動時突然出現呼吸急促、面色發白及咳嗽等過敏反應，並未能及時就醫，最終倒地身亡。現場未發現明顯的外傷，顯示未遭受暴力襲擊。"></p>

           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="The deceased was dressed in light spring clothing, with no visible blood or injuries. The facial expression indicated extreme distress, and the lips were a bluish-purple color, suggesting respiratory failure caused by an allergic reaction. There were no injuries or abnormalities observed on the limbs or chest, and the body posture appeared natural with no other unusual reactions. Witnesses recalled that before collapsing, the deceased experienced chest tightness and difficulty breathing, and was seen holding their chest with their hand." data-zh="死者身穿輕便春季衣物，未見血跡或創傷。面部表情顯示極度痛苦，嘴唇呈紫藍色，推測因過敏反應引發的呼吸衰竭所致。四肢及胸部無創傷或異常，身體姿勢自然，未見其他異常反應。目擊者回憶稱，死者在倒地之前曾感覺到胸悶及呼吸困難，並用手捂住胸口。"></p>

           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="Internal examination revealed significant edema in the respiratory tract and acute congestion in the lungs, accompanied by a small amount of fluid accumulation, suggesting acute allergic pulmonary edema. The heart and other internal organs showed no notable abnormalities, and there were no external injuries or other signs of trauma. Blood tests showed no suspicious toxins, with the only abnormal marker being elevated levels of allergic reaction indicators in the blood. These symptoms are consistent with a severe allergic reaction, particularly an acute response to pollen allergy." data-zh="經內部檢查顯示，發現死者的呼吸道存在明顯的水腫，肺部有急性充血現象，並伴有少量積水，推測為急性過敏性肺水腫。心臟和其他內臟器官無明顯異常，無外部創傷或其他損傷。血液檢測顯示無可疑毒物，唯一異常指標為血液中的高水平過敏反應指標。這些症狀均與嚴重的過敏反應有關，特別是花粉過敏的突發性急性反應。"></p>

           <p class="chinese-text report-text" data-en="Based on the autopsy and scene investigation,the preliminary determination of the cause of death is acute respiratory failure triggered by an excessive allergic reaction to pollen. The allergic reaction developed rapidly, leading to acute pulmonary edema, which ultimately caused death. The decedent did not receive timely medical assistance after the onset of symptoms, resulting in the worsening of the condition. There was no prior history of severe allergic reactions, but in an environment with high pollen concentrations, allergic responses can escalate quickly, especially when left untreated." data-zh="根據屍檢及現場調查結果，死者的死亡初步判定為過度花粉過敏反應引發的急性呼吸衰竭。該過敏反應迅速發展，並導致急性肺水腫，最終造成死亡。死者未能在發病後及時得到醫療幫助，導致病情惡化。死者先前未曾表現出過嚴重過敏反應的病史，但在高花粉濃度的環境中，過敏反應可能迅速加劇，特別是未及時處理的情況下。">
